## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Composite.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Kate Sevigny. I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University. I am originally from Daytona Beach, Florida, and there, I gained a strong appreciation for environmental conservation and sustainability. In my time at Cornell, I have realized I have a strong passion for clean and energy efficient systems, which is the broad industry I am most eager to apply my Mechanical Engineering coursework to. As a whole, I hope to use engineering to better humanity on the greatest possible scale.

Outside of the classroom, I am involved with my Solar Boat project team, where I use engineering principles to create an electrified drivetrain for a solar powered boat. I also exercise creativity in the Theme Park Engineering Group, where we are currently designing a Cornell Theme Park. I have a strong passion to give back to those in my community, which is exercised by my job as an Academic Excellence Workshop Facilitator, where I teach underclassmen engineers in Calculus 3 and Chemistry. Besides engineering, I also play and am Vice President of Women's Club Volleyball.
