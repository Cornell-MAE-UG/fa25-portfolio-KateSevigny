**Summary of Project**
The final project in the course MAE 3260: System Dynamics is a culmination of many topics learned throughout the class, such as ODE modeling and transfer functions, which are then applied to a new system. In my groups case, the system is the Human Heart. Individually, I researched the heart as a system, connecting it to systems we have studies, such as a RC circuit. From there, I modeled the system with a second order ODE in matlab.
