**My Contribution**
In my group, I started the dissection process, since my discussion section was first. I analyzed the chainsaw and began taking it apart, which led me to discovering the carburetor, a clear fluid mechanical concept in the chainsaw. I discovered this part when flipping the throttle on the chainsaw and seeing the valve open and close, depending on the switch position. The next time I went to take apart the chainsaw, we uncovered the engine in much greater detail. We were able to locate the crankshaft, connecting rod, and cylinder, as well as simulate the upstroke and downstrokes of the engine by rotating the side wheels. After gaining an understand of the innerworkings of the chainsaw, we moved to the theoretical portion of the dissection in the video. My contribution to the video is an in depth explanation of how a venturi in a carburetor works. This involves conservation of mass and Bernoulli equation analysis to show the pressure drop in the throat, which sucks up fuel, leading to combustible fluid for the engine.
